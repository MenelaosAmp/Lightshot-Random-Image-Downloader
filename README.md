# Lightshot-Random-Image-Downloader
This Python code, saves random images from Lightshot in a file called "light".


1. Installation of all necessary libraries.

2. Getting the path of the current PC.

3. Creation of the folder named "light" in: path\light
(If the folder already excists, it will fail and continue)

4. Creation of a list that includes all letters and numbers, so we can generate random 6-length combinations.

5. Agents setting.

6. Input of the amount of tries that user wants.(E.g. in the current code, the number of tries are 9)

7. Link Generation and attempt to retrieve the image. Either we get the image from that link, if it's available,
   or we skip that link in case that the image is no longer available.
